Covid Crowd Sourced covid tracking app.

A crowd sources COVID tracking application that shows which areas are hot zones & which are safe to visit in the current pandemic. The app uses userâ€™s location and publicly available data to color code different regions as Red, Yellow and, Green. The location data is stored anonymously. Users can check all this information using ESRI Maps.

Features:
1. A User can check in their current locations what are the hot zones.
2. A user can search for another location to find the same information about some other zone.
3. A user can update their own status to covid positive or negative.
4. If the user has provided an email id then in case the system detects that the user is at potential risk of having COVID, they will be sent an email.

All the regions are color codes as:
1. Red: Danger
2. Yellow: High Potential of becoming a danger zone.
3. Green: A safe zone

We use data from Publicly available APIs that provide city based Covid information and also used user location data in aggregation. This data is completely anynomous.
